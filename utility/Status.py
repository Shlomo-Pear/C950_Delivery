Do I make this a utility method or make this a method of Package.py?

Allows the ‘user’ to check the status (at the hub, en route, or delivery
time) of any package at any given time.

Develop a look-up function that takes the package ID as input and returns each of the following corresponding data components:
•   delivery address
•   delivery deadline
•   delivery city
•   delivery zip code
•   package weight
•   DELIVERY STATUS (I.E., AT THE HUB, EN ROUTE, OR DELIVERED), INCLUDING THE DELIVERY TIME
